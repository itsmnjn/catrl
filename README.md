# Catrl

[Catrl](https://catrl.co) is a cat-themed URL shortener, inspired by Gfycat's URL encoding scheme: instead of using jumbles of letters and numbers, they use an easy-to-remember adjective-adjective-noun scheme. Catrl, instead of a random noun, uses synonyms of the word "cat" (along with some extras hehe)!

## Technologies Used

- Node.js Lambda functions driving the back-end composed with the [Serverless](https://serverless.com) framework
- DynamoDB for fast, simple, NoSQL database
- S3 behind Cloudfront for image storage
- Pure HTML/CSS/JS driving the front-end :)
